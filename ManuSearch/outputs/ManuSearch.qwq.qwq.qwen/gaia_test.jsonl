Key details include:\\n\\n1. **Dried/Dehydrated Section**: \\n   - While no *new* standards for specific dried/dehydrated products were explicitly listed under July 2, 1959 (e.g., dehydrated peaches had standards effective Nov 1959 [[4]]), the overarching document consolidated existing standards. General criteria included: \\n     - Moisture content limits to ensure quality and safety.\\n     - Defect limits (e.g., mold, foreign matter).\\n     - Grade designations (U.S. Fancy, U.S. No. 1, etc.) based on appearance and condition [[1]][[3]].\\n\\n2. **Frozen/Chilled Section**: \\n   - **Carrots, Canned** (though technically canned, it falls under processed products): Standards effective July 2, 1959 (CFR §2852.671) [[2]][[5]].\\n   - Other frozen items like peas (May 28, 1959) and broccoli (March 1, 1959) were included but not newly established on this date [[3]].\\n   - Requirements for texture, color post-thawing, and packaging integrity were outlined in the broader standards [[1]].\\n\\nThese standards were formalized in the **Federal Register** and codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), reflecting USDA's regulatory framework for processed produce as of July 2, 1959 [[1]][[2]].\\n## Historical Question\\nHas the USDA standard CFR §2852.671 (canned carrots, July 2, 1959) been superseded by a newer version as of August 2023?\\nAnswer: Yes, the USDA standard CFR §2852.671 (canned carrots, July 2, 1959) has been superseded. Key updates include: \\n\\n1. **1998 Revision**: The standards were last formally issued on July 2, 1998 (effective August 3, 1998), amending and superseding prior versions, including the 1959 edition [[4]].\\n2. **2017 Overhaul**: In 2017, USDA revised 18 canned vegetable standards (including carrots) to adopt single-grade terminology, replacing dual nomenclature systems [[5]].\\n3. **Current Status**: As of August 2023, the latest applicable standards for canned carrots are found in updated USDA guidelines (e.g., 21 CFR §155.200) and the 1998-2017 revisions, rendering the 1959 version obsolete [[3]][[5]].\\n## Current Question\\nHave the general USDA standards for the 'dried and dehydrated' section established on July 2, 1959 (including moisture content limits, defect criteria, and grade designations) been superseded by newer versions as of August 2023?\",\n      [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-612e84df85a64df69c8a777c2a609b90\",\n          \"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": [\\\"USDA standards for dried and dehydrated fruits vegetables current 2023\\\", \\\"Have USDA's 1959 dried/dehydrated food standards been revised\\\", \\\"USDA CFR part for dried fruits updated after 1959\\\"], \\\"intent\\\": [\\\"Identify current USDA regulations for dried/dehydrated products as of 2023\\\", \\\"Determine if the 1959 standards were updated or replaced\\\", \\\"Locate updated Code of Federal Regulations sections post-1959\\\"]}\",\n          \"name\": \"GoogleSearch\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-c0c39e95e55249398a4851221bdecf6f\",\n          \"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": [\\\"USDA Agricultural Marketing Service dried fruit standards 2023\\\", \\\"Federal Register amendments to dried food standards since 1959\\\", \\\"USDA grade designations for dehydrated foods 2023\\\"], \\\"intent\\\": [\\\"Check USDA's official standards portal for current versions\\\", \\\"Find Federal Register entries showing amendments\\\", \\\"Verify current grade designations and criteria\\\"]}\",\n          \"name\": \"GoogleSearch\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-188d09c0d8894e22b83143cc83108f60\",\n          \"arguments\": \"{\\\"answer\\\": \\\"Yes, the USDA standards for the 'dried and dehydrated' section established on July 2, 1959, have been superseded by newer versions as of August 2023.

This navigates to the **High fantasy** page.\n   - **Step 2:** On the **High fantasy** page, locate the direct wikilink to *A Song of Ice and Fire* in the \"Examples\" or \"Modern works\" section. Clicking this link reaches the target page.\n\n2. **Pathway 2 (2 clicks):**\n   - **Step 1:** From *The Lord of the Rings* page, click the link to **J.R.R. Tolkien** in the infobox. Navigate to his author page.\n   - **Step 2:** On Tolkien’s page, find a mention of **George R.R. Martin** in the \"Legacy\" or \"Influence\" section (common due to Martin’s contrasting work). Click the link to Martin’s page, then proceed to *A Song of Ice and Fire* via its prominent listing there.\n\nBoth pathways require **2 clicks**, as the critical links are typically present.

Key components include:\\n\\n1. **Primary Crops**: Grains (e.g., wheat, rice)[[1]][[3]], grasses (e.g., forage crops)[[1]][[3]], and legumes (e.g., beans, lentils)[[2]][[3]].\\n2. **Specialty Crops**: Fiber crops (e.g., cotton)[[2]][[3]], sugar crops (e.g., sugarcane)[[2]][[3]], psychoactive crops (e.g., tea, coffee)[[1]][[3]], and herbs/spices (e.g., mint, chili)[[2]][[3]].\\n3. **Subcategories**: \\n   - 633.1: Grains [[3]]\\n   - 633.2: Grasses [[3]]\\n   - 633.5: Fiber crops [[3]]\\n   - 633.7: Psychoactive crops [[3]]\\n   - 633.8: Herbs and spices [[3]].\\n4. **Related Technologies**: Includes cultivation methods, processing, and conservation practices for these crops [[2]].\\n## Historical Question\\nHow did the BASE search engine represent document languages using flags in its 2020 interface design?\\nAnswer: Based on the search results, there is **no evidence** that the BASE search engine explicitly used flags to represent document languages in its 2020 interface design. Key findings include:\\n\\n1. The official BASE website [[4]][[6]][[10]] and related resources do not mention the use of flags for language representation in their 2020 interface.\\n2. General design guidelines (e.g., W3C, industry blogs) advise against using flags for language selection due to potential confusion [[9]], but this does not pertain to BASE specifically.\\n3. Search results focusing on BASE's interface or 2020 updates [[4]][[5]][[6]][[10]] highlight features like search filters and language selection options but do not reference flag-based indicators.\\n4. Technical discussions about flags in interfaces [[7]][[8]][[11]] are unrelated to BASE's implementation.\\n\\nConclusion: The available information suggests that BASE did not adopt flags to denote document languages in its 2020 interface, or such details were not publicly documented.\\n## Current Question\\nWhat DDC 633 entries in BASE from 2020 had documentation in non-standard or unrecognized languages?\",\n      [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-af63071ef3df404786a47f6c91bdbdbf\",\n          \"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": [\\\"BASE search engine DDC 633 2020 language documentation\\\", \\\"BASE academic search non-standard language entries 2020\\\", \\\"DDC 633 BASE 2020 unrecognized language documents\\\"], \\\"intent\\\": [\\\"Identify if BASE's 2020 DDC 633 entries included documentation in non-standard/unrecognized languages\\\", \\\"Check for reports or technical discussions about BASE's language handling for DDC 633 in 2020\\\", \\\"Find if BASE's 2020 metadata allowed filtering by non-standard languages for agricultural crop documents\\\"]}\",\n          \"name\": \"GoogleSearch\"\n        }\n      ],\n      {\n        \"role\": \"tool\",\n        \"tool_call_id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-af63071ef3df404786a47f6c91bdbdbf\",\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"18\\\": {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\", \\\"summ\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"More than 400 mio. scientific documents from more than 11.000 content ...

Though theaters in many areas began slowly opening their doors again, capacity restrictions and widespread uncertainty about the relative safety of the theatrical environment continued to dampen revenue. Only two films – Bad Boys for Life and Sonic the Hedgehog, both released prior to the nationwide shutdown of movie theaters – grossed north of $100 million in 2020, pointing to the devastation wrought by a once-in-a-century pandemic. With widespread vaccinations now on the horizon, we look ahead to a better year as we count down the top 10 box office performers of 2020.\\n\\nBad Boys for Life, which debuted with a franchise-best $62.5 million 3-day gross over MLK weekend, went on to gross $206.31 million domestically and was still in wide release when the pandemic hit. It may have been able to squeeze out a few million more were it not for COVID-19, but Bad Boys for Life had already made the majority of its money by that point.\\n\\nSonic the Hedgehog, released over President’s Day weekend, grossed a fantastic $58.02 million over the 3-day period and $70 million over the 4-day span before zooming to $146.07 million by the end of its pandemic-shortened run. Still in over 3,000 locations when the shutdown began, Sonic the Hedgehog was lucky enough to play for a full month before COVID-19 brought moviegoing to an abrupt halt across North America.\\n\\nBirds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn), considered a box office disappointment when it opened to just $33 million in early February, nonetheless lands as the third highest-grossing film in an unprecedented, catastrophic year for North American exhibitors. There wasn’t much gas left in the box office tank for the Suicide Squad spinoff when the pandemic shuttered movie theaters, so its $84.16 million final gross is pretty close to where it would have ended up even without the virus.\\n\\nThe Invisible Man, debuting to a robust $28.21 million over the final weekend of February, seemed a good bet to join the $100 million club before COVID-19 brought its theatrical run to an abrupt end two weeks later. Produced on a budget of just $7 million, The Invisible Man was nevertheless a highly-profitable runaway hit right out of the gate.\\n\\nOnward, Pixar’s first movie of 2020, was released on March 6, just two weekends before the pandemic shuttered theaters across North America. News of the coronavirus’ spread in the U.S. likely dampened turnout over its opening frame in early March, leading to a so-so $39.12 million debut. By Onward’s second weekend of release, a national panic had officially set in, and its sophomore frame plummeted nearly 73% before theaters closed their doors altogether.\\n\\nTenet, Christopher Nolan’s heady action-sci-fi, reached theaters over Labor Day weekend when the pandemic was on the wane in the U.S., leading to a momentary sense of relative calm during a brutal year.

Though theaters in many areas began slowly opening their doors again, capacity restrictions and widespread uncertainty about the relative safety of the theatrical environment continued to dampen revenue. Only two films – Bad Boys for Life and Sonic the Hedgehog, both released prior to the nationwide shutdown of movie theaters – grossed north of $100 million in 2020, pointing to the devastation wrought by a once-in-a-century pandemic. With widespread vaccinations now on the horizon, we look ahead to a better year as we count down the top 10 box office performers of 2020.\\\\n\\\\nBad Boys for Life, which debuted with a franchise-best $62.5 million 3-day gross over MLK weekend, went on to gross $206.31 million domestically and was still in wide release when the pandemic hit. It may have been able to squeeze out a few million more were it not for COVID-19, but Bad Boys for Life had already made the majority of its money by that point.\\\\n\\\\nSonic the Hedgehog, released over President’s Day weekend, grossed a fantastic $58.02 million over the 3-day period and $70 million over the 4-day span before zooming to $146.07 million by the end of its pandemic-shortened run. Still in over 3,000 locations when the shutdown began, Sonic the Hedgehog was lucky enough to play for a full month before COVID-19 brought moviegoing to an abrupt halt across North America.\\\\n\\\\nBirds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn), considered a box office disappointment when it opened to just $33 million in early February, nonetheless lands as the third highest-grossing film in an unprecedented, catastrophic year for North American exhibitors. There wasn’t much gas left in the box office tank for the Suicide Squad spinoff when the pandemic shuttered movie theaters, so its $84.16 million final gross is pretty close to where it would have ended up even without the virus.\\\\n\\\\nThe Invisible Man, debuting to a robust $28.21 million over the final weekend of February, seemed a good bet to join the $100 million club before COVID-19 brought its theatrical run to an abrupt end two weeks later. Produced on a budget of just $7 million, The Invisible Man was nevertheless a highly-profitable runaway hit right out of the gate.\\\\n\\\\nOnward, Pixar’s first movie of 2020, was released on March 6, just two weekends before the pandemic shuttered theaters across North America. News of the coronavirus’ spread in the U.S. likely dampened turnout over its opening frame in early March, leading to a so-so $39.12 million debut. By Onward’s second weekend of release, a national panic had officially set in, and its sophomore frame plummeted nearly 73% before theaters closed their doors altogether.\\\\n\\\\nTenet, Christopher Nolan’s heady action-sci-fi, reached theaters over Labor Day weekend when the pandemic was on the wane in the U.S., leading to a momentary sense of relative calm during a brutal year. However, the pandemic inevitably complicated analysis of Tenet’s theatrical performance, leaving it with just $57.91 million through the end of the year.\\\", \\\"date\\\": \\\"2021-01-22\\\"}, \\\"12\\\": {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104880/coronavirus-box-office-impact-north-america/\\\", \\\"summ\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"New York and Boston were also among the hardest hit with a revenue downturn of over 60 percent each from the weekend ending March 8, and number ...\\\\\\\"\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"Coronavirus impact: hardest hit box office markets North America 2020\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"The coronavirus has significantly impacted box office markets in North America, with notable downturns in revenue from the weekend ending March 8 to March 15, 2020.

Supporters of the cause expressed their sentiments in a music-hall ditty with this refrain:\\\\n\\\\nWe don't want to fight, yet by jingo if we do,\\\\nWe've got the ships, we've got the men,\\\\nWe've got the money, too!\\\\n\\\\nSomeone holding the attitude implied in the song became known as a jingo or jingoist, and the attitude itself was dubbed jingoism.

Direct driving distances between the cities (without strict reliance on I-90) are estimated at **~1,017 miles (1,637 km)** [[4]], but this route likely avoids I-90 entirely. The inconsistency arises because I-90 terminates in Boston, requiring additional connectors to reach Augusta.\\n## Current Question\\nWhat is the driving distance from Los Angeles, California to Cincinnati, Ohio via the most common route?\",\n      [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-f59ec7bc04e74ca98e9f3d6bfc8f780a\",\n          \"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": [\\\"Los Angeles to Cincinnati driving distance most common route\\\", \\\"Interstate 40 route from LA to Cincinnati distance\\\", \\\"distance LA to Cincinnati via I-40 and I-75\\\"], \\\"intent\\\": [\\\"Determine the standard driving route and distance between Los Angeles and Cincinnati\\\", \\\"Verify if Interstate 40 is the primary route and its endpoint near Cincinnati\\\", \\\"Calculate total distance combining I-40 with necessary connecting highways like I-75\\\"]}\",\n          \"name\": \"GoogleSearch\"\n        }\n      ],\n      {\n        \"role\": \"tool\",\n        \"tool_call_id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-f59ec7bc04e74ca98e9f3d6bfc8f780a\",\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"26\\\": {\\\"url\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"summ\\\": \\\"This is an official summary of Wikipedia's information as summarized by the authoritative Google: \\\\\\\"The distance between Los Angeles and Cincinnati is 1936 miles.

A fighter 1/wizard 5 could potentially wear plate armor if the fighter level was taken first. Other methods include taking a level in a class that grants heavy armor proficiency, such as Tempest or War Cleric, or being a race that provides armor proficiency, like a Mountain Dwarf.

It was authored by F. Yusef-Zadeh, R. G. Arendt, M. Wardle, I. Heywood, and W. Cotton. The study investigates the correlation between non-thermal radio filaments (NRFs) and IR stars in the inner few hundred parsecs of the Milky Way. The authors selected a sample of 57 radio sources that appear to be associated with NRFs, finding an apparent correlation between bright IR stars and NRFs based on their similar latitude distributions. They also examined archival 2MASS and Spitzer data to create spectral energy distributions of individual stellar sources coincident or close to radio sources. This association suggests models where NRFs are cometary tails produced by the interaction of a large-scale nuclear outflow with stellar wind bubbles in the Galactic Centre.\\\", \\\"date\\\": null}, \\\"8\\\": {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://scitechdaily.com/astronomers-stunned-by-discovery-of-mysterious-filaments-in-milky-ways-center/\\\", \\\"summ\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"Astrophysicists have discovered a new group of horizontal filaments radiating from the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.\\\\\\\"\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"Astronomers “Stunned” by Discovery of Mysterious Filaments in ...\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"\\\"}, \\\"9\\\": {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/06/230602115040.htm\\\", \\\"summ\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"Hundreds of horizontal filaments point toward our central supermassive black hole.

While some general OpenReview pages lack explicit process details [[2]][[3]][[5]], the collective evidence strongly supports the use of OpenReview.net for both submission and review phases.\\n## Historical Question\\nWhat were the official recommendation categories used in NeurIPS 2022's review process?\\nAnswer: The official recommendation categories used in NeurIPS 2022's review process were based on numerical scores with the following definitions:\\n\\n- **7: Accept**: Technically solid paper with high impact on at least one AI sub-area or moderate-to-high impact across multiple areas, accompanied by good evaluation, reproducibility, and addressed ethical considerations [[8]][[7]].\\n- **6: Weak Accept**: Technically solid with moderate-to-high impact and no major concerns regarding evaluation or ethics [[8]].\\n- **5: Borderline Accept**: Papers where technical strengths outweigh minor limitations (e.g., limited evaluation), though reviewers noted this category was shifted down compared to prior years (borderline accept became 5 instead of 6) [[8]].\\n- Lower scores (e.g., 4 or below) corresponded to rejection categories, such as 'Marginally below threshold' (5) or 'Reject' (4–1), with decreasing support for acceptance [[8]][[6]].\\n\\nThese categories were documented in reviewer guidelines and discussions among conference participants [[8]][[7]].\\n## Current Question\\nDoes the term 'certain' recommendation in the context of NeurIPS 2022 correspond to any specific numerical score or official category not explicitly listed in the reviewer guidelines?\",\n      [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-8daabffdc1134f40a2f6373f83b68cbe\",\n          \"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": [\\\"NeurIPS 2022 'certain' recommendation definition\\\", \\\"NeurIPS 2022 reviewer guidelines confidence levels\\\", \\\"NeurIPS 2022 official recommendation categories 'certain'\\\"], \\\"intent\\\": [\\\"Determine if 'certain' is an official recommendation category in NeurIPS 2022's review process\\\", \\\"Check if 'certain' relates to confidence ratings rather than numerical scores\\\", \\\"Identify whether 'certain' is mentioned in official documentation or review materials\\\"]}\",\n          \"name\": \"GoogleSearch\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-7fbbd24ed81a41638da898f55e4449a1\",\n          \"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": [\\\"NeurIPS 2022 review form structure\\\", \\\"NeurIPS 2022 'certain accept' in guidelines\\\", \\\"NeurIPS 2022 recommendation terminology\\\"], \\\"intent\\\": [\\\"Analyze the structure of the review form to see if 'certain' appears as a distinct category\\\", \\\"Verify if 'certain accept' is explicitly listed as a category with a specific score\\\", \\\"Confirm if 'certain' is part of the official terminology or informal usage\\\"]}\",\n          \"name\": \"GoogleSearch\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-3685327e2f994bbea3cec5902bd5cccc\",\n          \"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": [\\\"NeurIPS 2022 meta review examples 'certain'\\\", \\\"NeurIPS 2022 discussion forum mentions 'certain recommendation'\\\"], \\\"intent\\\": [\\\"Find examples of meta-reviews or discussions using 'certain' in recommendations to infer usage context\\\", \\\"Determine if the term appears in official communications or only community discussions\\\"]}\",\n          \"name\": \"GoogleSearch\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-7a7cfcdbad6140db9b9c9ad0c0b602a9\",\n          \"arguments\": \"{\\\"answer\\\": \\\"No, the term 'certain' recommendation does not correspond to a specific numerical score or official category in NeurIPS 2022's review process.

While Olympedia initially appeared to report a conflicting number (17 athletes [[10]]), the Wikipedia entry's specificity and recency (last updated 2024) take precedence per prioritization rules.

No contradictions from other sources were found, and the count aligns with the broader context of South American delegations at the time.\\n## Historical Question\\nHow many athletes did Switzerland send to the 1928 Summer Olympics?\\nAnswer: Switzerland sent **133 athletes** to the 1928 Summer Olympics [[14]][[11]][[13]]. This figure includes 132 men and 1 woman, as documented in the Wikipedia entry [[14]] and corroborated by the official edition summary [[11]]. The Olympian Database's mention of '1928 men' appears to be a formatting error unrelated to the 1928 Games [[12]].\\n## Historical Question\\nHow many athletes did Czechoslovakia send to the 1928 Summer Olympics?\\nAnswer: None\\n## Historical Question\\nHow many athletes did Italy send to the 1928 Summer Olympics?\\nAnswer: Italy sent **174 athletes** to the 1928 Summer Olympics [[15]][[16]][[17]][[18]]. This included 156 men and 18 women who competed in 81 events across 15 sports [[17]]. The figure is consistently reported by Wikipedia [[15]][[17]], Olympedia [[16]], and educational summaries [[18]].\\n## Historical Question\\nHow many athletes did Japan send to the 1928 Summer Olympics?\\nAnswer: Japan sent **43 athletes** to the 1928 Summer Olympics [[19]][[20]]. This figure is explicitly stated in Wikipedia's entry dedicated to Japan's participation [[20]], which confirms the team size and aligns with the summarized official data [[19]]. Olympedia's athlete count page for Japan [[21]] does not provide numerical details for 1928, but the consistency across credible sources like Wikipedia establishes 43 as the accurate count.\\n## Current Question\\nHow many athletes did Norway send to the 1928 Summer Olympics?\",\n      [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-3a5dcfae8c754bc6b1c30ca190a8afdc\",\n          \"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": [\\\"Norway 1928 Summer Olympics athletes number\\\", \\\"Norway Olympic team 1928 statistics\\\", \\\"1928 Amsterdam Olympics Norway delegation\\\"], \\\"intent\\\": [\\\"To find the exact number of athletes Norway sent to the 1928 Games using direct keyword search.\\\", \\\"To locate statistical data pages that might include athlete numbers, sports participated in, and events.\\\", \\\"To find information about Norway's delegation in the host city, which might include athlete counts.\\\"]}\",\n          \"name\": \"GoogleSearch\"\n        }\n      ],\n      {\n        \"role\": \"tool\",\n        \"tool_call_id\": \"chatcmpl-tool-3a5dcfae8c754bc6b1c30ca190a8afdc\",\n        \"content\": \"{\\\"41\\\": {\\\"url\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"summ\\\": \\\"This is an official summary of Wikipedia's information as summarized by the authoritative Google: \\\\\\\"Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees Country Athletes Norway 52 Luxembourg 46 Japan 43 Chile 38\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\\\"In total, 26 athletes including 23 men and three women represented Norway in five different sports including cross-country skiing, figure skating, Nordic combined, ski jumping and speed skating.

In the 2020 April episode, the magnetar released an X-ray burst storm along with an FRB (FRB 200428) with an X-ray counterpart. The mean burst duration of the observed 113 X-ray bursts (∼122 ms) is ∼30% shorter than in 2020 April but longer than most other activities. The mean spectral parameters (ΓCPL ∼ 0.82, Ep CPL ∼ 26 keV and kTBBs ∼ 5.10 keV, kTBBh ∼ 8.96 keV) are generally comparable to the previous activities but with a softer ΓCPL and larger RBBh than in 2020 April. The fluence–duration power-law correlation is ∼60% steeper in 2022 October and the other episodes than in 2020 April. The three new X-ray bursts associated with radio bursts stand out in being ∼2–10-fold longer than the mean duration, with X-ray-to-radio duration, flux, and fluence ratios of ∼102–3, 103–4, and 105–7, respectively, comparable to the XFRB1/FRB1 ratio for duration but larger for flux and fluence due to fainter radio bursts in 2022.\\\", \\\"date\\\": \\\"2025-01-30\\\"}, \\\"16\\\": {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/10/aa43339-22/aa43339-22.html\\\", \\\"summ\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"The localisation region of FRB 20201020A has been observed for 107.8 h with Apertif since the beginning of the survey in July 2019.
